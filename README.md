## Hi! Nice to see you 👋

Welcome to my page!

I'm Seungoh, **Front-End Developer** from **South Korea**.

Recently, I started learning Spring Boot.

### A little more about me...

  code: [React, Typescript, Nextjs, SpringBoot],
  tools: [ReactQuery, Recoil, Zustand, Tailwindcss, FramerMotion, Storybook, Jest],
  architecture: ["monorepo", "design system pattern"],
  challenge: "I am doing the migration of a JSP legacy project to React."
}
```
